			<h2>Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
		<div class="notes">
			<div class="subhead">World Wide Web</div>
			<p>
				The World Wide Web is a huge collection of <em>HTML documents</em>. It was invented in the 1990s and now it contains over 30 billion <em>web pages</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is how it works. When you visit a web page your computer sends a <em>HTTP request</em>  to a <em>server</em>  via  <em>the Internet</em>. The server finds the HTML document with all the files for the page and sends it back to your computer.  The <em>browser</em> on your computer interprets the information sent by the server and shows you the web page.  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48329854/m-48480496"> Here</a> is a good video about the components of the web.
			</p>
			<div class="subhead">HTML</div>
			<p>
				HTML (<em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>) is a special code for computers. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> (what you actually see on the page) and <em>markup</em> (how the content is arranged).
			</p>
			<div class="subhead">Tags</div>
				<p>
				HTML markup is made of different <em>tags</em>. Together with content they make up different types of <em>elements</em>. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723444">Here</a> is a video about structure of HTML documents.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tags are essential and you should be very carefull when writing HTML because computers are "stupid". Tags are instructions for them so even a smallest mistake can lead to a big problem.
			</p>
			<div class="subhead">Inline and block elements</div>
			<p>
			HTML elements can be <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements unlike inline ones create an "invisible box" around the content. The concept of boxes is very important in web programming.
			</p>

            <h2>Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h2>
		<div class="notes">
			<div class="subhead">Developer Tools</div>
			<p>
			Developer tools in Chrome browser shows the structure of the page. In Developer tools it is clearly seen that HTML elements form boxes on the page. 
			</p>
		<div class="subhead">Page Structure</div>
        	<p>
				The structure of any page is <em>"tree-like"</em>. It means HTML elements can be inside other elements.
			</p>
            <div class="image"><img src="images/tree-like.png" alt="Page structure"></div>
			<p>
				If you look at the structure of the page in Developer tools or any other tools you can see <em>sideway triangles</em> next to some of the elements. They indicate the "branching" structure and that these elements contain other elements. The more deeply "nested" in the structure an element is, the more <em>indented</em> it is in the code.
			</p>
		<div class="subhead">"Boxifying" design</div>
			<p>
				"Everything on the Web is boxes". Before writing a code of a web page it is important to "boxify" the design first - to cut your future page into boxes.
			</p>
		</div>

            <h2>Lesson 3: Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure</h2>
            <div class="notes">
                <div class="subhead">CSS</div>
			<p>
				CSS (<em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>) is a language which allows programmers apply style to HTML elements.  It also helps them <em>avoid repetition</em>.
			</p>
		
		<div class="subhead">Avoiding repetition</div>
		
			<p>
				"Don't repeat yourself" (DRY) is an important principle for software developers. The key feature of CSS that helps not to write the same code over and over is <em>inheritance</em>. It means that the style or rules applied to a <em>parent element</em> is inherited by all its <em>child elements</em>.
